Learning Objectives
---
1. Utility of numerical hydrodynamic predictions for maritime systems: ships, ocean platforms, & propulsors
2. Sources of errors in numerical predictions: modelling, truncation, & parametric errors
3. Numerical predictions pipeline: grid generation, parameter selection, solver execution, & results analysis
4. Choosing appropriate solvers based on modelling assumptions and computational limitations
5. Establishing numerical convergence and comparing results to experimental and field data
