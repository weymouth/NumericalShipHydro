    "# Numerical Panel Methods 🚢 \n",
    "\n",
    "A panel method is a numerical approach to constructing potential flows around engineering shapes such as an offshore platform, sail or ship hull. Panel methods are typically fast enough for design iteration on 3D geometries, but they come with modelling and numerical errors that need to be quantified. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Potential of a source panel 🚰\n",
    "\n",
    "The building block of the method is a surface panel; many of which are used to cover the boundaries of the flow domain. Each panel will have a different (constant) strength $q$, which are set such that flow moves around the engineering shape (not through it).  \n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity potential of a panel is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi(\\vec x) = q\\int\\int G(\\vec x,\\vec S(\\xi,\\zeta))\\ d\\xi d\\zeta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the surface of the panel, described by two coordinates, $\\xi,\\zeta$ and $G$ is the Green Function, which needs to be a solution of the laplace equations $\\nabla^2 G=0$. For every point $\\vec x$ where you want the potential, you must evaluate this double integral over the surface coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions inside this integral are known: the geometry $S$ is _the_ input (a portion of a sphere, a bit of the hull defined by a spline, etc), and we will choose $G$ to be the source potential\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G(\\vec x, \\vec a) = \\frac{-1}{|\\vec x-\\vec a|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, the integral for $\\phi$ is not analytically solvable, except for special-case $S$ shapes. This is in stark contrast to derivatives! If we had $\\phi=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi} G(x,S(\\xi,\\zeta))$ we would have no problem carrying out this derivative using the chain rule, even for complex shapes. Integrals don't have an equivalent rule that always works!"
