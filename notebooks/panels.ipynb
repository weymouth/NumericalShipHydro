    "# Numerical Panel Methods 🚢 \n",
    "\n",
    "A panel method is a numerical approach to constructing potential flows around engineering shapes such as an offshore platform, sail or ship hull. Panel methods are typically fast enough for design iteration on 3D geometries, but they come with modelling and numerical errors that need to be quantified. \n",
    "\n",
    "A panel method is a type of Boundary Element Methods (BEM), which have a rich and somewhat intimidating mathematical background. However, the mathematics and numerics of panels methods are very straightforward and give a good introduction to numerical analysis as well as being useful in application. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Method overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic steps of a potential flow panel method can be summarized as:\n",
    " - The boundaries of the fluid domain are given as an input and covered in small panels, each with their own influence potential $\\phi$.\n",
    " - The total potential $\\varphi$ defined as the superposition of each panel's $\\phi$ scaled by an unknown strength $q$.\n",
    " - The strengths are determined such that the flow boundary conditions, such as the normal velocity condition $U_n=\\frac{\\partial\\varphi}{\\partial n}$, are satisfied on every panel.\n",
    " - With the potential now defined, any quantity of interest can be measured, such as the surface pressure $p$ using $\\vec u=\\vec\\nabla\\varphi$ and the Bernoulli equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will developing a programme to follow these steps, and will raise (and address) a few important numerical questions in the process:\n",
    " 1. _How can we calculate the influence of each panel $\\phi$?_ **Gaussian quadratures.**\n",
    " 2. _How should we compute the derivatives of $\\phi$ and other functions?_ **Automatic differentiation.**\n",
    " 3. _How can we find the optimal $q$ for each panel?_ **Set-up and solve a linear system.**\n",
    " 4. _How should we determine if a method is working?_ **Convergence and validation tests.** \n",
    "\n",
    " We'll answer the first two questions in this notebook."

    "## Potential of a source panel 🚰\n",
    "\n",
    "The velocity potential of a panel per unit strength (called the _influence_) is defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi(\\vec x) = \\int\\int G(\\vec x,\\vec S(\\xi,\\zeta))\\ d\\xi d\\zeta $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $S$ is the surface of the panel, described by coordinates $\\xi$ and $\\zeta$, and $G$ is the Green Function, which needs to be a solution of the laplace equations $\\nabla^2 G=0$. For every point $\\vec x$ where you want the potential, you must evaluate this double integral over the surface coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The functions inside this integral are known: the geometry $S$ is _the_ input (a portion of a sphere, a bit of the hull defined by a spline, etc), and we will choose $G$ to be the source potential\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ G(\\vec x, \\vec c) = \\frac{-1}{|\\vec x-\\vec c|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite this, the integral for $\\phi$ is not analytically solvable, except for special-case $S$ shapes. This is in stark contrast to derivatives! If we had $\\phi=\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial \\xi} G(x,S(\\xi,\\zeta))$ we would have no problem carrying out this derivative using the chain rule, even for complex shapes. Integrals don't have an equivalent rule that always works! Our first question is therefore:\n",

    "## Numerical integration quadratures\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can't calculate the influence analytically, **quadratures** are simple and effective methods to numerically approximate integrals. Consider the integral\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F = \\int_{-h/2}^{h/2} f(x) dx $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $h$ is a small interval. You're already familiar with many example quadratures we can use to estimate this integral:\n",
    " - mid-point rule: $F \\approx h f(0)$\n",
    " - trapezoid rule: $F \\approx \\frac h2 [f(-h/2)+f(h/2)]$\n",
    " - Simpson's rule: $F \\approx \\frac h6 [f(-h/2)+4f(0)+f(h/2)]$\n",
    "\n",
    "These algorithms are all simple but they require 1,2 and 3 function evaluations, respectively. How much more accuracy are we getting for the increased amount of work? We can determine this by expressing $f$ in terms of it's Taylor series\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ f(x) = f_0+\\frac x2 f_0' + \\frac{x^2}6 f_0'' + \\frac{x^3}{12} f_0''' + \\ldots $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where subscript 0 denotes evaluation at $x=0$ and each tick $'$ indicates a derivative. Substitution into the integral and algebraic manipulation gives:\n",
    " - mid-point: $F = hf_0 + \\frac 1{24} h^3 f_0'' + O(h^4)$\n",
    " - trapezoid: $F = \\frac h2 [f(-h/2)+f(h/2)] -\\frac 1{12}h^3 f_0''+O(h^4)$\n",
    " - Simpson's: $F = \\frac h6 [f(-h/2)+4f(0)+f(h/2)] + O(h^4)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $O(h^4)$ means all the following terms are proportional to $h$ to the power of 4 or greater. Since the quadrature neglected these additional terms, they have a well-defined _truncation error_.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike system description errors or modelling errors, numerical truncation errors can be well estimated and controlled without access to the \"true\" result. We can see that the simple midpoint rule is quite accurate: **as long as the function is smooth such that the derivatives don't blow up, a small value of $h$ will make $h^3 f''$ negligible**. Surprisingly, the trapezoid rule _doubles_ the error of the midpoint rule and doubles evaluations, so it's not a good choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The midpoint rule applied to the influence potential integral gives:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\phi(\\vec x) \\approx A G(\\vec x,\\vec c)=\\frac{-A}{|\\vec x-\\vec c|} $$\n",
