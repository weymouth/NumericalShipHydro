# Numerical Panel Methods 🚢 

In the first notebook we studied

 > 1. _How can we calculate the influence of each panel?_ **Gaussian quadratures.**
 > 2. _How should we compute the derivatives of our functions?_ **Automatic differentiation.**

My Julia package `NeumannKelvin.jl` implements 3D panel potential using Gauss quadratures. Check the documentation for `∫G`, or [check the code](https://github.com/weymouth/NeumannKelvin.jl/blob/dcc8611a04beade8923ca9b45765da577cf2f5ad/src/panel_method.jl#L41). 

In this notebook we will actually start solving potential flow problems with panel methods addressing two more questions: 

 3. _How can we determine the correct strength for each panel?_ **Set-up and solve a linear system.**
 4. _How should we determine if a method is working?_ **Convergence and validation tests.**

## Sphere geometry

Our example problem will be the potential flow around a sphere. The `sphere` function below creates a vector of panels using the [parametric equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphere#Parametric) 

$[S_x,S_y,S_z] = R[\cos(θ₂)\sin(θ₁),\sin(θ₂)\sin(θ₁),\cos(θ₁)]$

where `θ₁,θ₂` are the azimuth and polar angles.

This function is the longest we've made so far (6 lines!) but each line is very simple:
1. Define the function `S(θ₁,θ₂)`, which looks identical to the equation.
2. Set the spacing so the panels at the equator are approximately $h \times h$.
3. Define a uniform sampling from pole-to-pole (latitudes).
4. Define a uniform sampling around the equator (longitudes).
5. Measure the panels by calling the function `measure` (defined in `NeumannKelvin.jl`) at each sample point using the transpose (`'`) and broadcast (`.`) notation.
6. Turn this panel data into a `Table` for pretty printing.

Let's set the panel size to `h=0.5R` and create an array of panels.

## Superposition 💧+💧+💧=💦

The potential of the full sphere is simply the superposition of each panel's contribution,

$\Phi(x) = \sum_{i=1}^N q_i \varphi_i(x)$

where $N$ is the number of panels, $q$ is the vector of **unknown** panel strengths and $\varphi_i$ is influence of panel $i$.

Our panel potential $\varphi_i$ uses a source as it's Greens function $G=-1/r$. Since $\nabla^2 G=0$, _any_ vector $q$ will satisfy the laplace equation $\nabla^2\Phi=0$ and be a valid potential flow. This is nice since we can't mess that up, but it means we need an additional equation to determine the _correct_ $q$ for a given geometry and flow condition.

> 3. _How can we determine the correct $q$ for each panel?_

## Apply boundary conditions

The additional equations from our problem description are the boundary conditions. Defining $\vec U$ as the free stream velocity and $\hat n$ as the surface normal, the conditions in an infinite fluid (no free surface) are
 - Flow tangency on the solid body's surface: $U_n+u_n = U_n+\frac{\partial\Phi}{\partial n}=0$
 - No disturbance far from the body: $u(\infty)\rightarrow 0$ 

The second condition is achieved automatically since $u(r) \sim \frac{\partial G}{\partial r} = 1/r^2$. Therefore, the first condition must be used to set $q$.

Substituting the equation for $\Phi$ into the body BC, we have

$\vec U \cdot \hat n + \sum_{j=1}^N \frac{\partial\varphi_j}{\partial n} q_j = 0 \quad\forall\ \vec x \in S$

This boundary condition is linear in $q$ and applies to every point on the body surface $S$. Applying the boundary condition at $N$ specific locations will create $N$ linear equations of the $N$ unknown components of $q$. We will choose the centroid of each panel $p_i$ to apply this condition. Defining 

$a_{ij} = \frac{\partial\varphi_j}{\partial n_i}, \quad b_i = -\vec U \cdot \hat n_i$

as the components of the influence matrix $A$ and the excitation vector $b$, we have

$\sum_{j=1}^N a_{ij} q_j = b_i \quad i=1\ldots N$

or simply $Aq = b$. Meaning once we construct `A,b` we simple use `q = A\b`.

## Verification

We got the solution to the linear system we created, but was that the right system? And how accurate is the solution?

> 4. _How should we determine if a method is working?_ 

As a first *sanity check*, we can plot the flow around the sphere. First we need to implement the equation for the total potential $\Phi(x)=\sum q_i φ_i(x)$, and the velocity $\vec u=\vec \nabla\Phi$. Then we can plot the flow at any point.

Looks good!
 - The flow seems to be wrapping around the circle, so the boundary condition is being enforced!
 - The arrow look a little smaller near the stagnation points and a little longer around the poles. But it is hard to tell for sure using a *qualitative* plot like this one...

## Validation and Convergence

To **validate** the method, we need to make a *quantitative* comparison to a known exact solution.

The analytic potential flow surface velocity on the sphere is

$u_\alpha = \frac 32 U \sin(\alpha)$

where $\alpha$ is the angle of the surface point with respect to the flow direction.

## Added mass

We can further quantify the panel method's error by computing a relevant **integrated quantity**. The added mass matrix is a good choice for potential flows, which is defined as 

$m_{i,j} = -\rho\oint_S \tilde\Phi_i n_j da$

where $\rho$ is the fluid desity and $\tilde\Phi_i$ is the scaled potential resulting from unit velocity in direction $i$. The forces due to an acceleration vector $a$ are then $f = Ma$.

The analytic solution for a sphere is $\frac 23 \rho \pi R^3$ on the diagonal and zero for the off diagonals. How does our numerical method perform?

## Summary

This notebook develops a 3D potential flow panel method and tests its predictions. The procedure had three parts:
 - We used the parametric equation for a sphere to generate panels data.
 - We used the normal velocity boundary condition to develop a set of linear equations for the strength of each panel.
 - We used the solution to measure the velocity on the panels, and the added mass matrix.

We were careful to visually and quantitatively check our intermediate results **at every step along the way**
 - We plotted the geometry and verified that every panel $dA\sim h^2$ and the total $A\approx 4\pi$.
 - We plotted the flow and visually checked that the boundary conditions were enforced.
 - We validated $|u|$ and $M$ by comparing to the analytic solution for the sphere, and demonstrated the numerical convergence with $h$.

The same three-part procedure and careful verification and validation will be present for every example we use in this class (and hopefully in your work in the future as well).
